  <title>2020 Land Cover Map of the Province of Palawan</title>
  <abstract>This dataset contains the spatial location, extent and distribution of various land cover types. The data was generated from digital interpretation of the 2018 to 2019 Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA) with 10-meter resolution and other available high-resolution satellite imagery. The Sentinel-2 was processed based on the 12 land cover categories, namely: Closed Forest, Open Forest, Mangrove Forest, Brush/Shrubs, Grassland, Perennial Crop, Annual Crop, Open/Barren, Built-up, Marshland/Swamp, Fishpond and Inland Water. These categories are consistent with the 2015 Land Cover Map classification scheme.
The dataset is referenced based on Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 50N projection with Philippine Reference System of 1992 (PRS92)as horizontal datum.


The 2020 Land Cover Map (LCM) of Palawan was produced by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) through its Land Cover Mapping project. The primary objective of the project is to generate detailed and updated nationwide land cover data by province through the application of satellite-based remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), complemented by a ground validation survey. The data serves as a vital input in the planning and management of the country's land resources for sustainable development.</abstract>

  <history>The 2020 LCM is derived from the image interpretation of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The processing utilizes the 7 bands of Sentinel-2 surface data, namely: visible blue, green, red, near-infrared, red-edge, and the two short-waved infrared bands. Preliminary processing is undertaken prior to image interpretation to make the data suitable for analysis. This activity includes resampling, layer-stacking, image-sub-setting and enhancement. In image sub-setting, approximate provincial boundary is used based on available references in the absence of official administrative boundary. Image interpretation of pre-processed Sentinel-2 data is carried out to classify the 12 land cover categories using Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) with the application of thresholding using different satellites bands and vegetation indices to delineate various land cover types. On-screen visual interpretation and manual editing as well as the use of existing GIS layers are further employed in the post-processing phase. Validation of preliminary LCM is done using sampling points generated through stratified random sampling. These sampling points are validated through field verification and/or visual image interpretation using available high-resolution satellite imagery like the Google Earth images. Classification accuracy is calculated by comparing the preliminary land cover data with the classification of the validated sampling points using confusion matrix. The preliminary output is presented to concerned stakeholders like the PENRO, CENRO, and LGUs to solicit their comments based on their knowledge of the area. Applicable comments and inputs from the stakeholders are incorporated during the final mapping. Quality control is also undertaken to further check for obvious misclassifications. Smoothing is applied to enhance the appearance of the data. Edge-matching and topology checking are also done to ensure consistent and seamless features. Projection transformation is performed on the final land cover data to conform with the standard data projection. </history>
